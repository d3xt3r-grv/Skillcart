A web Portal made using JAVA EE, API's , MYSQL  for Backend and Bootstrap , Javascript  for frontend. Basically Skillcart is a portal to connect near by labourers with the customers . Labourers just have to register at the portal and when they are free to work they can mark themselves available for work and then they are called by customers whenever demand occurs. The Labourers are maintained in a queue so that the labourer who raised hand earlier gets work earlier.when a labourer is selected for work he/she recieves an OTP on registered mobile number that is to be filled within 15 min at the portal so that both customer and labourer are given details of each other. If laburer fails to do so then second labourer is contacted after time quatuam expires. If after three trials we fail to provide a labourer to our customer , then they are informed about it and are requested to try again later. So basically it is guarantee to customer for sure shot reply within 40 min of request.  Also We used Aadhar Card Validation System.
